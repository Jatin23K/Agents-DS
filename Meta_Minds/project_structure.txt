├── .env   # This file is typically used to store environment variables, such as API keys
├── .gitignore  # Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore, such as compiled Python files ( __pycache__ ), virtual environment folders ( venv ), and potentially output files ( meta_output.txt ).
├── agents.py  # Contains the definitions for the CrewAI agents used in the project. These agents are configured with specific roles, goals, and backstories to perform tasks.
├── api.py  # code for setting up a web API, potentially using a framework like FastAPI (indicated by fastapi.exe and uvicorn.exe in the venv/Scripts directory), to interact with the data purification process programmatically.
├── config.py  # Handles application-wide configuration, including setting up logging and initializing the OpenAI client using the API key from the environment variables.
├── data_analyzer.py # Contains functions for analyzing the loaded data, such as generating summaries or descriptions of the datasets and their columns, likely utilizing the OpenAI client.
├── data_loader.py  #Responsible for loading data from various file formats (CSV, XLSX, JSON) into pandas DataFrames.
├── main.py  # The main entry point of the application. It orchestrates the entire workflow, from getting user input for file paths to processing data, creating agents and tasks, running the CrewAI, and saving the output.
├── meta_output.txt # The final output
├── output_handler.py  # Responsible for saving the final output of the data analysis process.
├── project_structure.txt
├── requirements.txt  # Lists the Python dependencies required for the project to run.
└─ tasks.py  # # Defines the CrewAI tasks that the agents will perform, such as analyzing data, generating questions, or comparing datasets.
